    <h2>So You're Ready to Migrate?</h2>

    <p>While it is by no means a quick or easy task to move to the cloud, there are some important steps to keep in mind to make it as smooth an experience as possible and avoid some of the risks listed on the <a href="risk-management.html">Risk Management</a> page.</p>

    <p><span class=p-heading>1. Understand What You Need</span>
    Before any work begins, it is important to take stock of exactly why you want to migrate to the cloud. In other words, without understanding how the cloud can enhance aspects of your particular business, you're likely to miss out on advantages the cloud has to offer.
    </p>

    <p><span class=p-heading>2. Perform a SWOT Analysis</span>
    Helping to understand what you need, a SWOT analysis can highlight your company's strengths and how it is excelling in those areas with its current IT architecture. On the other hand, this analysis will also reveal weaknesses which the company needs to improve and could do so with opportunities presented by Cloud Computing.
    </p>

    <p><span class=p-heading>3.Identify What To Migrate</span>
    By this point, you should have a clear picture of which aspects of your business operations would benefit most from being on the cloud. Now you should prioritize which specific business applications to migrate.
    </p>

    <p><span class=p-heading>4.Count the Cost</span>
    Having decided which applications would provide the most benefit if migrated to the cloud, you should now be looking at the <a href="project-estimates.html">costs</a> of service level agreements based on how much space you need and what kind of data you will be generating from those applications. These specifics will allow you to shop around and find a solution that meets your goals and target budget (Segal, "How to Migrate").
    </p>

    <p><span class=p-heading>5.Choose Carefully</span>
    Once you've identified the solution you need, do your due diligence in vetting the vendor. You want a cloud company that is reputable and trustworthy. Seek out recommendations for your chosen vendor from other business owners you know and trust. Once you've confirmed your vendor choice, be sure to get a detailed bid so there are no hidden costs that surprise you later.
    </p>

    <p><span class=p-heading>6.Plan & Monitor Carefully</span>
    Migrating to the cloud can be complex and time consuming. To ensure the smoothest transition, you should ensure your company has access to the necessary IT talent and skills to handle the migration and the required employee training after it is complete. You will also want to plan out a schedule and order of migration to minimize disruption to your business. You should set mile stones with deadlines and metrics to measure progress and define success but also incorporate some of these as checkpoints where the migration process can be stopped if/when necessary for any reason. All critical systems data should be backed up prior to transitioning to prevent loss during the process and the security of data should be closely monitored at all times (Gerber, "12 essential steps").
    </p>

    <p><span class=p-heading>7.Test</span>
    Finally, when the migration has been completed, it is a good idea to rigorously test your business applications on the cloud before making them live to your customers or employees. This will allow you to identify any weaknesses or flaws in your system and address them before they can cause issues with your business operaitons (Segal, "How to Migrate").
