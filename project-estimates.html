    <h2>Cost Comparison of Traditional vs. Cloud</h2>

    <p>
  One of the most important factors in deciding to choose a Cloud Computing solution over traditional in-house data centers is the cost difference in comparison to the benefits. While looking at the costs alone doesn't provide the whole picture, since I've covered the benefits of Cloud Computing on the Risk Management page, here I will just be looking at the costs. In order to understand the cost differences between traditional on-site data centers and cloud services, it is helpful to break down the costs of each model.
    </p>

    On average, the annual costs of running large on-site data centers can run between $10 million to $25 million per year for most companies.
    42% of that figure covers the amortized cost of the initial hardware purchase to set up the data center as well as the disaster recovery implementations, uninterrupted power supplies (UPS), networking and continued hardware expansions/upgrades necessary to manage the growing volumes of data companies generate. The remaining 58% of the cost covers the cooling, property fees and most notably labor costs of maintaining on-site data centers (Hurwitz, "Comparing Traditional Data").</p>

    <p>To get a rough idea of your company's monthly cost of operating a traditional data center, <a href="https://www.nfinit.com/cost-calculator/" target="_blank">NFINIT</a> provides a calculator that can give you a good base to work from. For instance, housing a small data center with just three racks at an average power consumption of 7kW per rack (West, "Understanding the Interplay Between Data") at the average rate of $0.13 per kW ("Electricity Rates by State") in a 400 sq. ft. space paying $2 per sq. ft. in rent and paying two support staff at an average of $2500 per month with minimal monthly maintenance costs of around $200 would still run a company over $10,000 each month to operate. This is only for a small data center and doesn't factor in the initial setup and hardware costs. The initial cost of some high-performance storage systems can reach upwards of $100,000 (Brand, "On-Premises Vs. Cloud"). These numbers scale very quickly when considering what most companies require today in our data-dependent world.
    </p>

    <p><span class=p-heading>Cloud Services</span><br><br>
    Calculating the comparable costs of cloud storage space and usage can be a bit tricky since it really depends on the level and types of service needed by the client. Most cloud service providers have <a href="https://calculator.aws/#/">pricing calculators</a> on their websites to give potential clients a good idea of the monthly costs for using their specific services. If we solely look at the cost of basic cloud storage with Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3), in comparison to a traditional onsite data center comprised of three racks which could hold around 60TB total, a company could access the same amount of storage through Amazon's cloud service for a little under $1500 per month. In this instance, the cost advantage of cloud services is very much highlighted. However, there may be some specific scenarios where business applications would still be better served by traditional onsite data centers. This should be determined during <a href="project-planning.html">project planning</a>.

    <h2>Additional Costs to Migrate</h2>
    <p>Beyond looking at the direct monthly cost comparisons of traditional vs cloud data storage, when considering a move to the cloud there are many other cost factors to consider. To get the best idea of what such a transition will actually cost, you should consider the following:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Migrating Data:</b> Ensuring data integrity when moving to Cloud Computing comes with a price. Since your operations will continue during this time, your business will not stop generating new data and will need to ensure data stays in sync between what is on-site and what gets migrated to the cloud. This requires labor and as a result, additional cost.</li>
        <li><b>Integration & Testing:</b> When moving applications to the cloud, there is always a chance that something doesn't work quite right. As a result, integration and testing are essential to ensure these applications can operate with the features and functionality needed. This also requires additional time and cost which should be accounted for.</li>
        <li><b>Consulting:</b> It is important to know up front whether your company has the required skills to perform a cloud migration without outside support. If not, expert assistance may need to be acquired at the cost of a consultancy fee (Chan, "How to calculate").</li>
      </ul>

    Keeping all of this in mind, the potential benefits of Cloud Computing in the majority of cases still far outweigh any expenses incurred to make the jump. Many companies have already discovered this for themselves. It is certainly worth looking into and could very well provide you with the competitive edge you've been looking for.
