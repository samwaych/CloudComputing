    <h2>Benefits of Cloud Computing</h2>
    <div class="grid">
    <p><b>Flexibility:</b> Cloud-based services allow for easy scalability. If demand for services or storage increases, a company need only to contact their cloud service provider to quickly increase access to additional server space. Likewise, if demand drops, it is easy to scale down the same way. This provides a level of flexibility not found with traditional in-house data center.</p>

    <p><b>Data Security & Recovery:</b> The security of data is paramount for any business. Any loss or compromising of sensitive data can set a company back greatly. Inherent to cloud computing is the ability to automatically back up data and recover it in the event of any type data loss. Reputable cloud service providers make data security and recoverability a top priority with layers of protection in place.</p>

    <p><b>No Software Updates:</b> Due to the nature of cloud services, software updates are handled on the back end of the service by the service provider. This means clients need not invest time in updating software to continue access and take advantage of any new features the service may implement.</p>

    <p><b>Pay As You Go:</b> Cloud Computing services follow a subscription model based on the type and amount of services you receive from the provider. Therefore, you only have to pay for the services and resources you use instead of incurring heavy costs from setting up and managing your own IT infrastructure and software resources.</p>

    <p><b>Near Unlimited Mobility:</b> Cloud services can be accessed from any device that can connect to the internet and run a web browser or mobile app. This means employees traveling or working from home can still access the files and services they need to continue conducting business.</p>

    <p><b>Foster Teamwork:</b> With access to work documents that can be shared and edited from nearly any location, collaboration is made easy through cloud computing. This only serves to enhance productivity and encourage teamwork.</p>

    <p><b>Document Version Control:</b> Since documents are stored in a central location with cloud services, your employees can stay on the same page so to speak. All documents can be made accessible to employees who are working collaboratively to greatly reduce the risk that someone has the wrong document version.</p>

    <p><b>Competitive Advantage:</b> Migrating to the cloud enables a business to be highly flexible and nimble. Instead of being tied into an outdated or bloated IT infrastructure that no longer meets the needs of customers, Cloud Computing enables a business to quickly adapt and provide the experience their customers desire.</p>

    <p><b>Sustainability:</b> Utilizing cloud services means your company only uses the server capacity it needs to conduct business. This makes cloud computing highly efficient and environmentally friendly, avoiding unnecessary use of energy and thereby decreasing a business' carbon footprint ("10 advantages of cloud computing").</p>

    <h2>Risks of Migrating to the Cloud</h2>
    <p><b>Lack of Migration Strategy:</b> When considering a move to cloud computing, it is best to have a clear plan in mind. For example, should you go with simply one cloud provider and deal with getting "locked-in" to that particular vendor or do you use more than one provider to balance workloads but also increase the complexity of managing those services?</p>

    <p><b>Incompatibility:</b> Existing IT architecture can be difficult to prepare for a move to the cloud without employees who have the proper IT skills and training. Even with the right resources, it can still be a long and complicated process depending on the architecture currently in place.</p>

    <p><b>Loss of Data:</b> During migration, without proper backup, some issues leading to data loss can take place such as corrupt, incomplete or missing files.</p>

    <p><b>Wasting Resources:</b> Though highly flexible, the pricing models for many cloud providers can be complicated and difficult to understand. Companies that neglect due diligence in understanding how service providers can meet their specific needs usually end up wasting resources by underutilizing the resources provided by their vendor(s).</p>

    <p><b>Increased Latency:</b> Because computing resources are outsourced from another geographic location with cloud computing, there is a risk for increased latency when accessing applications, databases and services.</p>

    <p><b>Lack of Visibility:</b> With cloud computing, the public cloud workload becomes the responsibility of the service provider instead of the client. This can lead to a lack of transparency and control which can in turn cause the client to experience application and network performance issues.</p>

    <p><b>Security Issues:</b> The biggest risk in migrating to the cloud revolves around the complex subject of data security. During the migration process, encountering issues ranging from compliance violations to malware attacks and insider threats are a possibility (Gavrylov, "7 risks").</p>
